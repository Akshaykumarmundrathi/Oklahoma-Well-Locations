# Oklahoma Well Locations Extraction and Map

## 📌 Project Overview

This project automates the extraction of well location information from Oklahoma well report PDFs. It parses metadata such as County, Section, Township, Range, and GPS coordinates from the reports, then generates:

- A structured Excel/CSV file with the extracted data  
- An interactive map (HTML) showing all well locations visually

## 🏆 Features

✅ Automated PDF parsing and extraction  
✅ Robust coordinate extraction from embedded URLs  
✅ Saves clean, tabular data for easy analysis  
✅ Creates an interactive Folium web map with clickable markers

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (PyMuPDF, pandas, regex, folium)  
- **JavaScript/HTML** (Folium-generated map)  
- Google Drive, GitHub for hosting and sharing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Akshaykumarmundrathi/Oklahoma-Well-Locations.git
cd Oklahoma-Well-Locations
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Place the Input PDF

Put your well report PDF (e.g., `PDFs_Well_Location_20250523_140405.pdf`) in the project folder.

### 4️⃣ Run the Extraction Script

```
python oklahoma_well_location_map.py
```

This will generate the extracted Excel/CSV and interactive map files.

## 📊 Visualization

Open the generated `.html` map file in your web browser to interact with well locations on a map.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Some report fields may be missing due to PDF format variations or incomplete extraction.  
- Coordinates are extracted only if URLs in the PDF follow expected formats.  
- The extraction assumes consistent report formatting. Irregularities may require tweaking regex patterns.

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests and issues are welcome! Feel free to suggest improvements or help expand the extraction capabilities.
