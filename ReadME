# Oklahoma Well Locations Extraction and Interactive Map

## Overview

This project automates the extraction of well location data for Oklahoma wells from PDF reports and visualizes the data on an interactive map.

It extracts key location details such as County, Township, Range, Section, and geographic coordinates (Latitude and Longitude) directly from the PDFs using Python. Results are saved in structured Excel/CSV files and displayed on a web map.

## Files and Structure

- `PDFs_Well_Location_20250523_140405.pdf`  
  Original input PDF containing well reports.

- `oklahoma_well_location_map.py`  
  Python script that extracts data from the PDF, processes it, and creates the output files and map.

- `oklahoma_wells_text_extract_with_latlon.xlsx` (or `.csv`)  
  Output spreadsheet with extracted locations and coordinates. Some cells may be blank due to ongoing extraction process.

- `index.html` or `oklahoma_wells_map.html`  
  The interactive Folium map illustrating well locations, viewable in any modern browser.

- `README.md`  
  Project documentation (this file).

## Setup and Running

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Akshaykumarmundrathi/Oklahoma-Well-Locations.git
cd Oklahoma-Well-Locations
```

2. Install required Python packages:

```
pip install PyMuPDF pytesseract pdf2image pandas openpyxl requests pyproj opencv-python-headless tqdm folium
```

*(On Linux or Google Colab, install Poppler for PDF handling:)*

```
sudo apt-get -y install poppler-utils
```

3. Place the input PDF in the project folder or update the `pdf_path` variable in the script accordingly.

4. Run the script:

```
python oklahoma_well_location_map.py
```

This will create the extracted data file and interactive map.

## How to View Results

- Open the generated Excel or CSV file in any spreadsheet application to review the extracted well location data.

- Open the generated HTML map file (`index.html` or `oklahoma_wells_map.html`) in a browser to interact with the mapped well locations.

## Current Limitations

- Extraction is partial; some cells are blank reflecting incomplete parsing.

- The script relies on certain consistent PDF formats; variations may require adjustments.

- Coordinates extraction depends on correctly formatted URLs in the PDF.

- The interactive map only shows wells with valid lat/lon data.

## Next Steps

- Enhance extraction robustness and OCR integration for scanned PDFs.

- Expand regex patterns to cover different report variations.

- Improve map features with clustering, filtering, and shapefile overlays.

- Incorporate user interface for manual correction/validation of extracted data.
